# BoNeMEAL
**Managing a Minecraft server is hard. Punishing players for misbehaviour shouldn't be.**

The **b**a**n** **m**anagement w**e**b **a**pp**l**ication (BoNeMEAL) makes it easy to manage your server's bans, mutes, kicks and warnings. It's designed to extend the [Ban-Management Bukkit plugin](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ban-management/) created by confuser by providing a clean, easy and responsive way to manage your punishments.

# About this project

This project was started to offer an alternative or even a possible replacement for the clumsy "BanManager WebUI".
BoNeMEAL is built with Laravel 5 together with tons of other awesome tools, frameworks and libraries such as Composer, gulp.js, Bootstrap, jQuery etc.
